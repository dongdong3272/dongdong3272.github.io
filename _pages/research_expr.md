_I would like to thank all the professors, senior students and organizations for providing me with the research opportunities and hand-on experiences below._

#### 1. **[FYP] When Viusal Query Interfaces meet Graph Query Engine** _(June. 2022 - May. 2023)_

##### _(Supervisor: [Prof. ZHOU Xiaofang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/zxf), Otto Poon Professor of Engineering and Chair Professor, Head of Department)_

- The goal of this project is to design and implement a Visual Query Interface (VQI) that is compatible with Neo4j, namely VisualNeo, to help non-expert users do graph queries. VisualNeo will include many cutting-edge and useful functions such as data-driven VQI design, action-aware graph query processing, and effective query results visualization, which are novel features of recently published VQIs.

- This work has been accepted by VLDB 2023. The publication link will be posted once it is available.

#### 2. **Frontend Developer of HKUST Path Advisor Project** _(Feb. 2022 - Jun. 2022)_

##### _(Supervisor: [Prof. Raymond Wong](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/raymond-chi-wing-wong), Associate Head (Education) and Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Associate Director of Sino Software Research Institute)_

- [HKUST Path Advisor](https://pathadvisor.ust.hk/) is a system which could help users to find locations in our UST map easily. Currently, HKUST Path Advisor Version 2.0 is being operated.
- Contribution: Improve venue suggestion: Add a scroll bar in the suggestion list; Implement an error correction feature so that it can suggest a list of database venues based on users' input;

#### 3. **Research on Front-end Web Design and Improvement of T-Music Web System** _(Sep. 2020 - Dec. 2020)_

##### _(Supervisor: [Prof. Raymond Wong](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/raymond-chi-wing-wong), Associate Head (Education) and Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Associate Director of Sino Software Research Institute)_

- T-Music is an algorithm that composes a series of musical notes from input lyrics using frequent pattern mining and other data mining techniques. T-Music Web System is a maintainable and scalable system that deploy the usage of the algorithm. However, the implementation of the web system has not been completed yet and there is some future work to do. This project aims to equip us the basic front-end web design skills as well as to implement some new features based on the original web system.
